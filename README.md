# Hello-World


When you use Jenkins for continuous integration, you can quickly have disk usage problems on slave nodes and sometimes with the master node too. Disk usage problems happen when you have many jobs . For example one of our jobs is taking up to 2GB. Therefore where Jenkins sits we might have disk usage problems.
